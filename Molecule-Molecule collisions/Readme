Important downloads are MATLAB, LAMMPS, OVITO(to display any dump file simulation), mpiexec, and a text editor (e.g: Atom, Visual Studio Code).


for all datafiles generated they are put into a folder "D:\EMIBF4_equilibration\"

## LAMMPS: 
in.sys_elec2 equillibrates the molecules at a given temperature( here being 300 K). It loops between variables for the seed number of the internal state
given in internalstate.txt.
Values for initial particles placements are given in EMIBF4.dat. In EMIBF4.dat, the first column of the atoms segment means atom number,
the second is the molecule you want the particle to start in, the third is what atom it is based on the numbers on masses, 
the fourth column is the particle charge. The next three columns are the x, y, and z positions. 


## MATLAB: 
Real_datafiles_generator uses the datafile created from in.sys_elec2 to generate files of varying KE(translating to the velocity) of the monomer,
impact parameter, theta_y and theta_z of the molecule. The code varies the theta relative to the center of mass of the molecule. 
The datafiles generated are written eq_SYST_#_#_KE#_Imp#_IntState#.dat. It puts the datafiles into a folder called data_files.

## LAMMPS:
in.run_all reads the files generated from before by reading from 5 text scripts phiyvalues.txt, phizvalues.txt, kevalues.txt, ImpParvalues.txt,
and InternalState.txt. Running it creates a dump file adn log file.

## MATLAB:
produce_mass_spectrum reads the dump files created places the dump file into the identify_species code to identify which atoms are close enough
to be considered as the same molecule. Then, produce_mass_spectrum creates a plot of the mass spectrum.

All LAMMPS files run using command prompt on Windows using the following command:

mpiexec in 6 lmp_mpi -in (code used)
